# Mini Project 2: Predicting Students' Final Grades Using Supervised Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict students' final grades (on a scale of 0 to 5) in a fully online, nine-week-long machine learning course. The dataset consists of various student performance metrics, including:
- Quiz grades
- Mini-project scores
- Peer review evaluations
- Course log interactions

Two supervised learning models have been trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for grade prediction.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaning and structuring student performance data.
  - Feature engineering based on course engagement.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:**
  - Two supervised learning models were trained.
  - Performance comparison using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- **Predictive Analysis:**
  - Provides insights into factors influencing student performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and modeling)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling and analysis)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
