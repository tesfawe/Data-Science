# Mini Project 3: Art Analysis Using Network Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the use of network analysis in the field of art history by analyzing digital collections from WikiArt. The goal is to construct and analyze a network of artists, movements, institutions, and schools to uncover key insights, such as:
- Influential artists and art movements
- Impact of institutions on the art world
- Geographical distribution of artists
- Largest communities within the art network

Network analysis provides a powerful way to visualize and study relationships that are otherwise difficult to analyze using traditional methods.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Processing:**
  - Extracts artist and movement data from WikiArt.
  - Constructs an interconnected network of artists, movements, and institutions.
- **Network Analysis & Visualization:**
  - Identifies key influencers in the art world.
  - Analyzes connections between art movements and institutions.
  - Visualizes geographical distributions of artists.
- **Community Detection:**
  - Finds the largest clusters within the art network.
  - Analyzes relationships among different entities.


## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **NetworkX** (for network construction and analysis)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
