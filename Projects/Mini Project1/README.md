# Mini Project 1: Recipe Web Scraper

## Overview
This project aims to solve the challenge of efficiently finding healthy and delicious recipes that fit specific dietary needs. The solution involves developing a web scraper that collects recipe data from the first 50 pages of [skinnytaste.com](https://www.skinnytaste.com/). The scraped data includes:
- Recipe names
- Calorie counts
- Personal points
- Summaries
- Recipe keys
- Images

An interactive user interface (UI) allows users to input their desired calorie and personal point ranges, and the system filters and returns the top ten recipes that match their criteria, sorted in descending order based on calories.
